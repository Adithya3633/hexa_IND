 Leaf Disease Detection (AI/ML Project)
 Project Purpose
This project aims to detect plant leaf diseases using machine learning techniques.  
It helps in identifying unhealthy leaves early, which can assist farmers and researchers in preventing crop damage.  
The goal is to demonstrate the integration of AI/ML models with a web application for practical agricultural solutions.

Technologies Used
- Python  
- Flask (for backend web framework)  
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for frontend)  
- Machine Learning (classification models)  
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib (data preprocessing & visualization)  
- scikit-learn / TensorFlow (model training & evaluation)  
- SQL / Database integration (for storing results)
